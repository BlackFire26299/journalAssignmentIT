## Prototyping
the prototype videos will be sent along with the files, they are named intuitively (Proto1, Proto2, Proto3) watch each video with the corresponding paragraph.
### Prototype1:
In this Prototype I have started the development process by taking my design made in figma and redesigning the basic layout in qt designer. This step has set out the ground work for the rest of the project and how the code will be laid out. The steps I will take going forward will be to implement the basic functions of a text editor first and then go on to adding more complex functions such as the md viewing and the date saving. The first step I will take will be adding the basic text editor.


### Prototype2:
In this prototype I have added the main features of a text editor to the app plus the ability to view the file in markdown formatting and the calendar (which does not do anything at this stage). The improvements to be made are to allow the saving of dates in entries and to allow the calendar to be interacted with in the date saving process. The main problems this build are the lack of features and options the users have. The code is simple and going well. The next step is adding the other icons and buttons to allow more functionality such as saving files, deleting them, and opening other folders. Also adding the ability to see and store other files in the software cache. so changes stay while the software is open even when the file isn't saved.

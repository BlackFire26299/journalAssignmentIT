I started preplanning on the 28/08

I then made a prototype of the visuals of the app on the 30/08

I designed the app in QTDesigner on the 02/09
- I designed the app so that it had a minimum size of 500 width and 200 height 
- I also configured the app so that when the window was resized everything else would resize correctly within the app.
- i used the main colours of: `#512250` and `#813680`
- I used grid layouts to make this auto resizing possible.

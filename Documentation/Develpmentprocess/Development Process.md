## Prototyping

### Prototype1:
In this Prototype I have started the development process by taking my design made in figma and redesigning the basic layout in qt designer. This step has set out the ground work for the rest of the project and how the code will be laid out. The steps I will take going forward will be to implement the basic functions of a text editor first and then go on to adding more complex functions such as the md viewing and the date saving. The first step I will take will be adding the basic text editor.

## Main Features

* Able to interact with the date
* Can allow free text inputs
* Enable saving and viewing of old entries
* Save entries and allow them to be accessed later

## Extra Features I would like to include

 - A command line interface for easy git access
 - chose to open any folder and automatically read any markdown files. 
 - settings page to specify different things
 - Users can specify if they want to search for markdown or text documents or both
 - Users can manually add new files that have been created in software
 - Have the user be able to switch from markdown editing (markdown without the styling) to markdown viewing (markdown with the styling) with a hotkey
-  Have there be a kind of workspace system where the user can separate their notes in different directories. The app will then globally remember the workspaces the user can open.
## Extra Features I would like to include if I have time
- live markdown processing so that you wouldn't have to switch in-between viewing and editing

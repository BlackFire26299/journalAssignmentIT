- Use markdown as the storage and make it so it can be previewed. Markdown allows for both just normal text editing and also stylized editing
- Have there be a kind of workspace system where the user can separate their notes in different directories. The app will then globally remember the workspaces the user can open.
- save some of the settings globally
- and save some locally in the created workspace directory. 
- Users can specify how many directories down they want the app to search for markdown or txt files when opening a new folder
- Users can specify if they want to search for markdown or text documents or both
- Users can manually add new files that have been created in software
- Have the user be able to switch from markdown editing (markdown without the styling) to markdown viewing (markdown with the styling) with a hotkey

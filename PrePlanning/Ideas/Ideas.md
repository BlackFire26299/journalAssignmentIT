## Ideas 28/08/25

- Use markdown as the storage and make it so it can be previewed. Markdown allows for both just normal text editing and also stylized editing
- maybe have the option to change between markdown and normal text files to accommodate for normal users
- Have there be a kind of workspace system where the user can separate their notes in different directories
- save some of the settings globally
- and save some locally in the created workspace directory. 
- Users can specify how many directories down they want the app to search for markdown or txt files when opening a new folder
- Users can specify if they want to search for markdown or text documents 
- Users can manually add new files that have been created in software

- Use markdown as the storage and make it so it can be previewed. Markdown allows for both just normal text editing and also stylized editing
- Have there be a kind of workspace system where the user can separate their notes in different directories. The app will then globally remember the workspaces the user can open.
- save some of the settings globally
- and save some locally in the created workspace directory. 
- Users can manually add new files that have been created in software:
```
create button with refresh icon.
link button to a class function.
class function:
search for all markdown files in the current directory and add them to a
list. (this is done by checking if the last 3 characters of the file name 
are ".md") Iterate through that list and add each of the file names to a list 
view widget along with the set date of the entry.
```
- Have the user be able to switch from markdown editing (markdown without the styling) to markdown viewing (markdown with the styling) with a hotkey
- use the creation date of a file to save the date of the entry
